# How do I give feedback about Connect IQ?

We love feedback - feel free to [contact us](https://developer.garmin.com/contact/). The team will review your message and get back to you as soon as we can.

We don't have any rules about what feedback you can give, but we would love it if you read the rest of the page to learn how to make sure your feedback is constructive.

## Found a bug?

The first thing we do with a bug report is confirm we can reproduce the bug. Please try to give us enough information so that we can produce the buggy experience ourselves:

Try to include:
* What steps you took just before the bug.
* What you were expecting to happen when the bug happened.
* What actually happened - the buggy behaviour itself.
* What web browser you were using.

If you fill in your name and email address on the feedback form (or use github) we'll be able to let you know when the bug is fixed, and contact you if we need more information.

If youâ€™re reporting a bug in the software and want to work with the team directly we invite you to bypass the feedback form and [submit an issue on Github](https://github.com/garmin/connectiq-apps/issues/new).

Before reporting an issue:
* Please have a brief look to see if the issue is already listed. If so please add any extra, clarifying information you can to the existing issue.
